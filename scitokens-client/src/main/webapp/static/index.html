    <title>A Sample SciTokens Client </title>
</head>
<body>
Welcome to the sample Java client for SciTokens!<br><br>

This will let you test getting a scitoken from the associated server. It is not intended to
be more than an example.<br><br>

<form action="startRequest" method="post">
    Enter scopes with a single space between each one or one per line:
    <br>
    <textarea id="scopes" rows="5" cols="80" name="scopes"></textarea>
    <br>
    The audience for the requested scopes:<br>
    <input type="text" size="25" name="resource"/>
    <br>
    <td><input type="submit" value="start"/></td>
</form>

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
<p>The talk of scopes and such tends to be confusing, so here are the main terms defined:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>scope</b> = a permission of the form operation:path, e.g. read:/public/data</li>
    <li><b>issuer</b> = the service that created the SciToken (in this case, the URL of this server)</li>
    <li><b>audience</b> = the URL (or possibly name) of the service that uses the permissions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported templates</h2>

<p>Templates operate with respect to the service that is to consume the scope.
This client has two sets of audiences:</p>

<h3>A set for anyone who can log in</h3>

<ul>
    <li>{"read":"/public/**"}</li>
    <li>{"write":"/public/**"}</li>
    <li>{"read":"/home/${username}/**"}</li>
    <li>{"write":"/home/${username}/**"}</li>
    <li>{"queue":"/home/${username}/queueit/**"}</li>
    <li>{"execute":"/home/${username}/runit/**"}</li>
</ul>
<p>The audience here is <code>https://demo.scitokens.org/xrootd</code></p>

<h3>Another set, for NCSA members</h3>

<ul>
    <li>{"read":"/home/${username}/**"}</li>
    <li>{"write":"/home/${username}/**"}</li>
    <li>{"read":"home/${group}/dataset/**"}</li>
    <li>{"write":"/home/${group}/${username}/results/**"}</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all for the audience <code>https://demo.ncsa.illinois.edu</code> You must be in a valid group
within the NCSA to use one of these templates. Failure to be in one will result in an error.
</p>

<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>Here are some simple examples. On that should always work if your login works is to set the scope to</p>
<pre>
    read:/public write:/public
</pre>
and the audience to
<pre>
    https://demo.scitokens.org/xrootd
</pre>

<p>If your login name is thor for NCSA, you can have scopes like</p>
<pre>
    read:/home/thor write:/home/thor/lsst/data.hdf
</pre>
and the audience is
<pre>
    https://demo.ncsa.illinois.edu
</pre>
<p>Note that this gives general read access to your home directory but restricts the write to a specific file. The
template allows for subdirectories and files.</p>
